# Conversation Summary

## Project Goal
Develop and refine the Wanderline Python system for single-stroke drawing to mimic a motif image, focusing on reproducibility, transparency, experiment management, and usability.

## Completed Tasks
- **Greedy Agent:** Implemented a greedy agent (`choose_next_angle`) and integrated it with `run_test.py` via the `--greedy` flag.
- **Output Management:** Each run now creates a timestamped subfolder under `outputs/` to store all artifacts.
- **Rich Outputs:** The system now outputs:
    - A video of the drawing process (`drawing.mp4`).
    - Initial and final canvas images.
    - A log of the distance (loss) at each step.
    - A plot of the loss curve (`distance_curve.png`).
- **Reproducibility & Experiment Management:**
    - **Early Stopping:** Implemented with `--patience` and `--min-delta` arguments.
    - **Run Summary:** Saves the run configuration and convergence status in `run_summary.json`.
    - **Experiment Resumption:** Added a `--resume_from` feature to continue a previous run, restoring the canvas, motif, step count, and loss history.
- **Bug Fixes & Refinements:**
    - **Color Handling:** Fixed color issues by ensuring all OpenCV operations use BGR, with explicit conversions and comments for clarity.
    - **Video Codec:** Changed the video codec to `avc1` (H.264) for better macOS compatibility.
    - **Starting Point:** The drawing now starts from the darkest point of the motif image by default.
- **Testing:**
    - All changes have been tested with `pytest`, and all tests pass.
    - Manual runs have confirmed that video output and the resume feature are working correctly.

## Pending Tasks
- **Improve Documentation:** Enhance the help/usage documentation for `run_test.py`.
- **Modularization:** Consider refactoring `run_test.py` if it becomes too large, following the project's coding rules.
- **Advanced Agents:** Implement non-greedy agent methods.
- **CI/CD:** Add more comprehensive integration tests and set up a CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions).

## Code State
The following files have been created or modified and are in a stable state:
- `docs/coding_rules.md`
- `docs/detailed_design.md`
- `wanderline/agent.py`
- `wanderline/canvas.py`
- `wanderline/reward.py`
- `wanderline/video_recorder.py`
- `wanderline/image_utils.py`
- `wanderline/plot_utils.py`
- `run_test.py`
- `pyproject.toml`
- `tests/test_canvas.py`
- `tests/test_reward.py`

All major usability, reproducibility, and experiment management features have been implemented and tested. The system is now robust and ready for further development.

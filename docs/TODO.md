# TODO / Task List for Wanderline

## ðŸš¨ CODE CONSERVATION EMERGENCY

**CRITICAL PRIORITY**: Address severe resource waste before any new features.

### Phase 1: Immediate Waste Elimination (URGENT)
**Start here - Low risk, high impact**

1. **Remove 5 Redundant Implementations** âš¡ START HERE
   - Delete: `_choose_next_angle_greedy()`, `_choose_next_angle_lookahead()` in agent.py  
   - Delete: `choose_next_angle_vectorized()`, `choose_next_angle_vectorized_lookahead()` 
   - Keep only: Memory-efficient variants from memory_efficient_canvas.py
   - **Expected**: 65% code reduction (~900 lines removed)

2. **Configuration Explosion Cleanup**
   - Remove: `use_vectorized`, `use_full_vectorization`, `adaptive_sampling`, etc.
   - Keep only: `memory_efficient`, `steps`, `opacity`, `duration` (essential 10)
   - **Expected**: 35+ parameters â†’ 10 parameters

3. **Delete Workaround Files**
   - Delete: `fast_agent.py` (324 lines of workarounds)
   - Integrate memory-efficient logic directly into agent.py
   - **Expected**: 324 lines eliminated

### Phase 2: Architecture Reform (STRATEGIC)
**After Phase 1 stabilizes**

4. **Root Cause Fix: Canvasâ†’Stroke Architecture**
   - Replace: Full canvas copying with incremental pixel evaluation
   - Redesign: `apply_stroke()` to return affected pixel coordinates only
   - **Expected**: 15,000x memory reduction, 2-3x speed improvement

5. **Single Algorithm Path**
   - Unify all angle selection into one well-designed implementation
   - Remove complex routing logic in `choose_next_angle()`
   - **Expected**: Eliminate function call overhead, cleaner codebase

     - Provides user feedback when window is resized
   - **Tested with**: Default sample (4:3), sample3.png (16:9), sample2.png (3:2)

2. ~~**UI Text Cleanup**: Remove unwanted "p option (print path)" text from OpenCV window~~ âœ… **COMPLETED**

### Memory Optimization for Long Runs
**Context**: 10000+ step runs cause system crashes. Need to decide on memory management strategy.

- **Coordinate-only Recording**: Record xy coordinates, reconstruct video later
  - Need to determine: storage format, reconstruction algorithm, canvas state handling
  - Question: How to balance memory savings vs reconstruction complexity?
